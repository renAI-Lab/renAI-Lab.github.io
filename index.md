I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the <a href="https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank"><b>Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</b></a>, and director of the <b>renAI Lab</b>. I completed my <b>Ph.D.</b> studies at the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank"><b>University of Illinois</b></a> under <a href="https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Heng Ji</b></a>, after which I spent time visiting <b>MIT</b>.
<br><br>
My research focus centers around <b>human-centered trustworthy AI/NLP</b> with <b>cognitively-grounded multimodal reasoning</b> capability and <b>scalable alignment</b> principles. My work on fundamental model architectural mechanisms and frameworks empowering <b><b><i>helpful</i></b>, <i><b>honest</b></i>, and <i>harmless</i></b> information communication has been recognized by <b>three best/outstanding paper awards</b> at <b>top conferences</b>.
