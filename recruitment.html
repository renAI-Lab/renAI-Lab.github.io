            <h1>Join Ren.AI Lab</h1>
            The Ren.AI Lab led by Dr. Yi R. (May) Fung from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is actively recruiting PhD/Mphil students, postdoctoral fellows, research assistants and visiting interns. Dr. Fung is committed to advancing research in human-centric trustworthy AI/NLP model reasoning, with a focus on scalable alignment principles and multimodal knowledge robustness mechanisms. She has rich academic experience and provides excellent resources and mentorship for group members.

            <h2>Who Are We</h2>
            The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is a top and internationally renowned research university (ranked 34th in the world in the 2022 QS World University Rankings, ranked the 10th in the world under the subject of Data Science and AI). HKUST is located on the Clear Water Bay in Hong Kong. It is built on the mountain facing the sea and has an ideal research environment. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering of HKUST ranks among the best in the world ranking of computer science and engineering.

            Dr. Yi R. (May) Fung is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Illinois, after which she spent time visiting MIT as a postdoctoral researcher. She has published over 30 papers at top-tier machine learning venues along the topics of MLLM agentic frameworks, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-lingual cross-culture situation understanding. Her research has received international recognition, including the ACL'24 Outstanding Paper Award, NAACL'24 Outstanding Paper Award, and NAACL'21 Best Demo Paper Award.

            <h2>Recruitment Details</h2>
            PhD/Mphil students can be enrolled in the spring or fall of each year, and a full scholarship (about HKD 18,500 per month) will be provided. Outstanding candidates are recommended to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS). The amount of the HKPFS is around HKD 26,600 per month, plus a travel allowance of HKD 13,300 each year. In addition, HKUST gives each awardee a one-time reward of HKD 40,000.

            Postdoctoral fellows holding a doctorate in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, or related fields are welcome. Requirements include:
            - Strong programming skills in deep learning frameworks, e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
            - Experience in NLP, machine learning, or AI projects is preferred
            - Publications in top-tier AI or NLP conferences/journals such as ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc., are preferred
            - Strong self-motivation and curiosity are preferred

            For undergraduate and master students, research positions such as visiting intern and research assistant are also available. A minimum of 3 months is required (remote mode is also acceptable).
